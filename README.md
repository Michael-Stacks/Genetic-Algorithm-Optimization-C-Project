Genetic Algorithm Optimization ‚Äì C++ Project
üîç A Genetic Algorithm Application Built in C++

This project implements a modular and efficient Genetic Algorithm designed to solve complex optimization problems. It applies evolutionary principles‚Äîselection, crossover, and mutation‚Äîto evolve a population of candidate solutions, progressively converging towards optimal or near-optimal results.

üöÄ Features & Concepts Implemented
Modular Programming: Well-organized code with clear separation of concerns across population initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement.
Evolutionary Operators: Customizable selection, crossover, and mutation strategies to explore and exploit the solution space effectively.
Dynamic Memory Management: Efficient handling of populations and offspring using dynamic memory techniques in C++.
DLL Integration: Uses dynamic library functions to encapsulate problem-specific operations, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
Parameter Customization: Easily adjust population size, crossover/mutation probabilities, and termination criteria to suit various optimization challenges.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Language: C++
Programming Paradigm: Procedural and Modular Programming
Development Style: Clean, Modular, and Efficient Code
